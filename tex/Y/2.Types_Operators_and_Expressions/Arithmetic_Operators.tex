\subsection{Arithmetic Operators}

The binary arithmetic operators are \texttt{+}, \texttt{-},
\texttt{*}, \texttt{/} and the modulus operator \texttt{\%}.
The binary operator \texttt{+} and \texttt{-} operators have the
same precedence, which is lower than the precedence of \texttt{*},
\texttt{/}, and \texttt{\%}. Arithmetic operators associate left
to right.
