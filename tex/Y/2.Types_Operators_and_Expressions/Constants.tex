\subsection{Constants} \label{const}

One can declare a specific variable to never be changed, in any scope,
via the keyword \texttt{\_\_const}:
\begin{lstlisting}
    ubyte __const char = 'A';
\end{lstlisting}
This \texttt{char} variable can never change value; any attempt to it
will throw an error.
Constant variables must have a initialization value, otherwise, its
utility is quite limited.

The \texttt{\_\_const} keyword must always be between a variable
type and its name.
