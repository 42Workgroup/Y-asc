\subsection{Declarations}

All variables must be declared before use, although certain
declarations can be made implicity by content. A declaration
specifies a type, an optionnal flag and a name.

\begin{lstlisting}
    u32                 count, j;
    bool __const        ret = true;
\end{lstlisting}

Variables can be distributed among declarations in any fashion; the
list above could well be written as

\begin{lstlisting}
    u32         count;
    u32         j;
\end{lstlisting}

A variable may also be initialized in its declaration. If the name
is followed by an equals signs and an expression, the expression
serves as an initializer. Constant variables must be initialized,
see the \ref{const} section for more information.

The flag between the type and the name is implemented by the language,
and should always be in this position.
