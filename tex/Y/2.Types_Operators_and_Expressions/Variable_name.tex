\subsection{Variable names} \label{varnames}

Variable names are made up of letters and digits; the first character
must be a letter. A letter is, in this context, a character inside
the English dictionnary, through the letters \texttt{a} to \texttt{z}.
All other symbols from other languages / Unicode are not supported,
and will throw an error upon reading. The underscore \texttt{\_}
count as a letter. All variable must be in lowercase, as uppercase
names are reserved to namespaces.
Keywords like \texttt{if}, \texttt{else}, \texttt{struct}, etc., are
reserved: They cannot be used as variables names.

A variable name cannot be used twice in a scope: If such a thing
would happen, an error will be thrown. However, different variables
can have the same name in differents namespaces. See the \ref{namespaces}
section for more information.
