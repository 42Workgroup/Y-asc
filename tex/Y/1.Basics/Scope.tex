\subsection{Scope}

As many programming languages, Y use a couple of brackets \texttt{\{\}}
to determine scope. Scope is to be determined on special instructions,
like conditions, functions and namespaces.

\begin{lstlisting}
    if (condition) {
        /* If's scope */
    }

    [...]

    function(ubyte[] : str) : bool {
        /* Function's scope */
    }
\end{lstlisting}

One can use brackets to determine an internal scope, that serve no
other purpose that limiting variable use

\begin{lstlisting}
    {
        u32 num = 2;

        print("Num is equal to %u\n", num);
    }
    /* Cannot use num here */
\end{lstlisting}
