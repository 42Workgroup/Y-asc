\subsection{Instructions}

In the Y language, one must declare an instruction with a \texttt{;} at the end
of it

\begin{lstlisting}
    instruction;
\end{lstlisting}

One can chain instruction on the same line, regardless of line breaks

\begin{lstlisting}
    instruction1; instruction2;
\end{lstlisting}

It is worth noting that the Y language does not care about line returns,
in whatever standards (\textbackslash n, \textbackslash r\textbackslash n, ..)
