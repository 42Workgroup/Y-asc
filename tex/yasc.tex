    \section{Types, Operators and Expressions}
        Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a
        program. Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what type
        they have and perhaps what their inititial values are. Operators
        specify what is to be done with them. Expressions combine variables and
        constants to produce new values. The type of an object determines the set
        of values it can have and what operations can be performed on it. These
        building blocks are the topic of this chapter.

    \section{Control Flow}
        The control-flow of a language specify the order in which computations
        are performed. We have already met the most common control-flow constructions
        in earlier examples; here we will complete the set, and be more precise
        about the ones discussed before.
        \subsection{If-Else}
            The \texttt{if-else} statement is used to express decisions. Formally
            the syntax is
            \begin{lstlisting}
    if (expression)
        statement1
    else
        statement2
            \end{lstlisting}
            where the else part is optional. The \texttt{expression} is evaluated;
            if it is true (that is, if \texttt{expression} has a non-zero value),
            \texttt{statement1} is executed. If it is false, (\texttt{expression} is zero)
            and there is an else part, \texttt{statement2} is executed instead.

            Since an \texttt{if} test the numeric value of an expression, certain
            shortcuts are possible. The most obvious is writing
            \begin{lstlisting}
    if (expression)
            \end{lstlisting}
            instead of
            \begin{lstlisting}
    if (expression != 0)
            \end{lstlisting}
            Because the \texttt{else} part on an \texttt{if-else} is optionnal,
            there is ambiguity when an else if ommited from a nested \texttt{if}
            sequence. This is resolved by associating the \texttt{else} with
            the closest previous \texttt{else}-less \texttt{if}. For example, in
            \begin{lstlisting}
    if (n > 0)
        if (a > b)
            z = a;
        else
            z = b;
            \end{lstlisting}
            the \texttt{else} goes to the inner \texttt{if}, as we have shown by
            indentation. If that isn't the desired behaviore, one must use braces
            to force the proper association:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    if (n > 0) {
        if (a > b)
            z = a;
    }
    else
        z = b;
            \end{lstlisting}

        \subsection{Else-If}
            The construction
            \begin{lstlisting}
    if (expression)
        statement;
    else if (expression)
        statement;
    else if (expression)
        statement;
    else if (expression)
        statement;
    else if (expression)
        statement;
    else
        statement;
            \end{lstlisting}
            occurs so often that is worth a brief separate discussion. This
            sequence of \texttt{if} statements is the most general way of writing
            a multi-way decision. The \texttt{expressions} are evaluated in order;
            if an \texttt{expression} is true, the \texttt{statement} associated
            with it is executed, and this terminates the whole chain. As always,
            the code for each \texttt{statement} is either a single statement,
            or a group of them in braces.

            The last \texttt{else} part handles 'none of the above' or default
            case where none of the other conditions is satisfied. Sometimes there
            is no explicit action for the default; in that case the trailing
            \begin{lstlisting}
    else
        statement;
            \end{lstlisting}
            can be ommited, or it may be used for error checking to catch an
            'impossible' condition.
        \subsection{Loops - While}
            In
            \begin{lstlisting}
    while (expression)
        statement;
            \end{lstlisting}
            the \texttt{expression} is evaluated. It it is non-zero, \texttt{statement}
            is executed and \texttt{expression} is re-evaluated. This cyccle continutes
            until \texttt{expression} becomes zero, at which point execution
            resumes after \texttt{statement}.
        \subsection{Loops - For}
            The \texttt{for} statement
            \begin{lstlisting}
    for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
        statement;
            \end{lstlisting}
            is equivalent to
            \begin{lstlisting}
    expr1;
    while (expr2) {
        statement;
        expr3;
    }
            \end{lstlisting}
            except for the behaviour of \texttt{continue}, which is described
            in section \ref{break_n_continue}.

            Grammatically, the three components of a \texttt{for} loop are
            expressions. Most commonly, \texttt{expr1} and \texttt{expr3} are
            assignements or function calls and \texttt{expr2} is a relational
            expressions. Any of the three parts can be ommited, although the 
            semicolons \texttt{;} must remain. You can find a simple example
            of a \texttt{for} usage below:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    u8          i;
    ubyte[]     str = "Hello !";

    for (i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; i++)
        print("Letter position %d is %c\n", i, str[i]);
            \end{lstlisting}
        \subsection{Loops - Do-While}
            As we discussed earlier, the \texttt{while} and \texttt{for} loops
            test the termination condition at the top. By contrast, the \texttt{do-while}
            loop tests at the bottom \texttt{after} making each pass through the 
            loop body; the body is always executed at least once.

            The syntax of the \texttt{do} is
            \begin{lstlisting}
    do
        statement;
    while (expression);
            \end{lstlisting}
            The \texttt{statement} is executed, then \texttt{expression} is
            evaluated. If it is true, \texttt{statement} is evaluated again, and so on.
            When the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.
        \subsection{Break and Continue} \label{break_n_continue}
            It is sometimes convenient to be able to exit from a loop other than
            by testing at the top or bottom. The \texttt{break} statement provides
            an early exit from \texttt{for}, \texttt{while} and \texttt{do}.
            A \texttt{break} causes the innermost enclosing loop to be exited
            immediately.

            The \texttt{continue} statement is related to \texttt{break}: it
            causes the next iteration of the enclosing \texttt{for}, \texttt{while} or
            \texttt{do} loop to begin. In the \texttt{while} and \texttt{do}, this means
            that the test part is executed immediately; in the \texttt{for}, control
            passes to the increment step.
    \section{Functions and Program Structure}
        Functions break large computing tasks into smaller ones, and enable people
        to build on what others have done instead of starting over from scratch.
        Appropriate functions hide details of operation from parts of the program
        that don't need to know about them, thus clarifying the whole, and easing
        the pain of making changes.
        \subsection{Basics}
            A function is declared like
            \begin{lstlisting}
                function_name(arguments) : return-type {
                    statement;
                }
            \end{lstlisting}
            A function is identified by its name. Function names are made up
            of letters and digits; the first character
            must be a letter. A letter is, in this context, a character inside
            the English dictionnary, through the letters \texttt{a} to \texttt{z}.
            All other symbols from other languages / Unicode are not supported,
            and will throw an error upon reading. The underscore \texttt{\_}
            count as a letter. All function must be in lowercase, as uppercase
            names are reserved to namespaces.
            Keywords like \texttt{if}, \texttt{else}, \texttt{struct}, etc., are
            reserved: They cannot be used as functions names.

            The \texttt{arguments} is a list of a variables passed to the function.
            In
            \begin{lstlisting}
                ubyte[] : str, u32 : num
            \end{lstlisting}
            The first argument, \texttt{str} is an array of \texttt{ubyte}, and
            the second one, \texttt{num}, is an unsigned integer on 32 bits.

            The \texttt{return\_type} of the function is declared after the list
            of arguments, using the character \texttt{:}. This return type
            must be respected in the function, with the \texttt{return} keyword.
            For example, the following function is wrong:
            \begin{lstlisting}
                compute_division(u32 : first, u32 : second) : u32 {
                    [...]
                    return "Hello !";
                }
            \end{lstlisting}
            since it is returning a \texttt{string}, instead of an \texttt{u32}.

            A function can take no arguments, or return nothing: in this case,
            the type \texttt{void} must be used
            \begin{lstlisting}
                function_that_does_nothing(void) : void {
                    [Nothingness...]
                }
            \end{lstlisting}
            That function can be called with
            \begin{lstlisting}
                function_that_does_nothing();
            \end{lstlisting}

        \subsection{External Variables}
            A Y program consists of a set of external objects, wich are either
            variables or functions. The adjective \texttt{external} is used in
            contrast to \texttt{internal}, which descibres the arguments and
            variables defined inside functions. External variables are defined
            outside any function, and are thus potentially available to many
            functions. Functions themselves are always external, because Y
            does not allow functions to be defined in other functions. By
            default, external variables and functions have the property that
            all references to them by the same name, even from functions compiled
            separately, are references to the same thing. (We usually call this
            property \texttt{external linkage}.) To declare a global variable,
            one must simply declare it out of any scope.
        \subsection{Namespaces} \label{namespaces}
            Namespaces are used to limit scope of functions. They must be declared
            via the keyword \texttt{def}, with brackets to delimit the scope.
            Namespaces names are made up of letters and digits; the first character
            must be a letter, in uppercase: Lowercase names are reserved to variables.

            Example of a namespace declaration:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    def Namespace_name {
        [...]
    };
            \end{lstlisting}
            Functions can be declared in a namespace:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    def Namespace_name {
        function_name(ubyte[] : str) : bool {
            [...]
            return true;
        }
    };
            \end{lstlisting}
            Any functions declared in a namespace is meant to be used with this
            namespace. In order to use a specific namespace, one must declare it:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    use Namespace_name;
            \end{lstlisting}
            The keyword \texttt{use} used with the namespace name will allow
            the call of all functions in this namespace. In order to use one
            function of this namespace, one can use an accessor on the namespace name:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    use Namespace_name.function_name;
            \end{lstlisting}
            With this declaration, any other function of this namespace used in
            code will throw an error.

            With proper usage of the keyword \texttt{use}, one can use a
            namespace's function in the following way:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    Namespace_name.function_name("Hello!");
            \end{lstlisting}

            Since namespaces are a limited scope, they can be two functions with
            the same name, in two different namespaces but they must always be used
            with a proper accessor; this way, the compiler / interpreter will
            never be confused as what function should be called.
            However, take the following example:

            \begin{lstlisting}
    def Namespace_one {
        hello(void) : void {
            print("Hello from one");
        }
    };

    def Namespace_two {
        use Namespace_one;

        hello(void) : void {
            print("Hello from two");
            hello();
        }
    };
            \end{lstlisting}
            In the \texttt{Namespace\_two} function \texttt{hello}, we call a
            function named \texttt{hello}: In this specific case, the function
            called will be the one of the current namespace, thus resulting in
            an infinite loop. If one must use a same named function in another
            namespace, a proper accessor must be used:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    def Namespace_one {
        hello(void) : void {
            print("Hello from one");
        }
    };

    def Namespace_two {
        use Namespace_one;

        hello(void) : void {
            print("Hello from two");
            Namespace_two.hello();
        }
    };

            \end{lstlisting}
            The same logic can be used for globals functions named the same as
            namespace's function:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    hello(void) : void {
        print("Hello from one");
    }

    def Namespace_two {
        hello(void) : void {
            print("Hello from two");
            hello();
        }
    };
            \end{lstlisting}
            Here, in the \texttt{Namespace\_two.hello} function, the function
            called will be itself. However, if one call the \texttt{hello} function
            from a global scope, such as \texttt{main}, the global scope will be used:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    hello(void) : void {
        print("Hello from one");
    }

    def Namespace_two {
        hello(void) : void {
            print("Hello from two");
        }
    };

    use Namespace_two;

    main(u32 : ac, ubyte[]* : av) : u32 {
        hello();
        return 0;
    }
            \end{lstlisting}
    Will return:
            \begin{lstlisting}
    > Hello from one
            \end{lstlisting}
            If one must use the \texttt{Namespace\_two} \texttt{hello} function,
            a proper accessor must be used, as shown above.

        \subsection{Header Files}
        \subsection{Static Variables}
            One can declare a specific variable to be declared once, and won't
            be destroyed at the end of its scope. This is done by using the
            keyword \texttt{\_\_static}
            \begin{lstlisting}
    function(void) : void {
        u8 __static     counter = 0;

        print("Counter is $%d\n", counter);
        counter = counter + 1;
    }
            \end{lstlisting}
            If we are to use this function like
            \begin{lstlisting}
    function();
    function();
    function();
            \end{lstlisting}
            The output will be
            \begin{lstlisting}
    > Counter is 0
    > Counter is 1
    > Counter is 2
            \end{lstlisting}
            Take note that this variable can't be used out of its scope, like
            a normal one. Since this variable is only declared once, it must have
            an initialization value, like a constant.
    \section{Preprocessor}
        Y provides certain language facilities by means of a preprocessor, which
        is conceptionally a separate first step in compilation.
        \subsection{File inclusion}
            File inclusions makes it easy to handle collections of declarations.
            Any source line of the form
            \begin{lstlisting}
    #include "filename"
            \end{lstlisting}
            or
            \begin{lstlisting}
    #include <filename>
            \end{lstlisting}
            is replaced by the content of \texttt{filename}.
        \subsection{Macro Substitution}
            A definition has the form
            \begin{lstlisting}
    #define name replacement text
            \end{lstlisting}
            It calls for a macro substitution of the simplest kind - subsequent
            occurences of the token \texttt{name} will be replaced by the
            \texttt{replacement text}. The name in a \texttt{\#define} has the
            same form as a variable name; the replacement text is arbitrary.
            Normally the replacement text is the rest of the line, but a long
            definition may be continued onto several lines by placing a \textbackslash
            (antislash) at the end of each line to be continued. The scope of a
            name defined with \texttt{\#define} is from its point of definition to
            the end of the source file. A definition may use previous definitions.
            Substitutions are made only for tokens, and do not take place within
            quoted strings.
        \subsection{Conditions}
            It is possible to control preprocessing itself with conditional
            statements that are evaluated during preprocessing. This provides
            a way to include code selectively, depending on the value of
            conditions evaluated during compilation.

            The \texttt{\#if} line evaluates a constant integer expression. If
            the expression is non-zero, subsequent lines until an \texttt{\#endif}
            or \texttt{\#elif} or \texttt{\#else} are included.
